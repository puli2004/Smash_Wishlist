# Smash_Wishlist
This is my wish list at the moment for smash as the years go by.

- [ ] Minecraft plugin // Makes charaters look more alike in their game and adds two more monsters. Coming soon. No gameplay but there will be a little trailer though.
- [ ] Movie_one_slot // I am not finishing this. Fuck that.
- [ ] Camera_one_slot // No clue where to find it. Still a maybe but not the right moment
- [ ] Sora hit UI //Sound is added. UI won't be added but the sound is finished.
- [ ] Riku as a fighter // Waiting on folder addition
- [ ] Geno as a fighter
- [ ] Remaking mario moveset
- [x] street fighter victory call //Did it and it was easy but I'll wait to release it
- [x] Unsharing theme that were shared
- [ ] Make FD melee// Light are missing including background................................. I'm comforming that I'll do a melee revap in smash with all models remastered and mechanics. And yes anyone that wasn't in melee will be cut out till I feel like adding someone in. But must be someone from that time.
- [ ] Add goofy and donald for sora
- [ ] Make my own charater in the game // I'm looking up to it
- [ ] Redesign Young Link.//Folder Addition
