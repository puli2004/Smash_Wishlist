- [ ] Movie_one_slot // I am not finishing this. Fuck that.
- [ ] Camera_one_slot // No clue where to find it. Still a maybe but not the right moment
- [ ] Sora hit UI //Sound is added. Now its just need ui. 50%
- [ ] Riku as a fighter // Waiting on folder addition
- [ ] Geno as a fighter
- [ ] Remaking mario moveset
- [ ] Add street fighter victory call
- [x] Unsharing theme that were shared
- [ ] Make FD melee
- [ ] Add goofy and donald for sora
- [ ] Make my own charater in the game // I'm looking up to it
- [ ] Redesign Young Link.
- [ ] Import UE5 Battlefield to SSBU// This is just a request from a buddy. UE5 is somthing at the moment.
