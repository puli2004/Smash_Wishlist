# Smash_Wishlist
This is my wish list at the moment for smash as the years go by.

The wishlist has now become a asset to a upcoming mod pack. Meaning anything thats finished won't be out.
Only thing that will be out is a hp mod and thats it. And for victory stages. Anytime a character is in its final states a development and victor map will be
going to github.

If any questions hit me up on discord.

Finished: 
- [x] Minecraft Legacy Mod // Its finished. Release day: 
- [x] Sora hit UI //Finished. Released
- [x] street fighter victory call //This won't get released till patching to sli_sound with using orginal is possible
- [x] Unsharing theme that were shared// Its done but the Unique victory can unshare the files by just putting the theme in the folder

Marked: For Later on.
- [ ] Geno as a fighter
- [ ] Remaking mario moveset

- [ ] Make my own charater in the game // I'm looking up to it
- [ ] Redesign Young Link.//Folder Addition

- [ ] Fixing the Unique Stage mod. Music won't return to the original music. Causing the game to crash due to it not finding it in the folder.
